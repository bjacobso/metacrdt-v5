; forma-zero prelude
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The Forma Zero kernel from specs/vision/forma-zero.md, written in the shared
; Forma dialect so the same source runs on @forma/ts (dynamic) and
; @forma/ocaml (HM-typechecked).
;
; Representation — chosen to satisfy both engines:
;   fact      = a 3-vector of strings          ["ben" "works-for" "onboarded"]
;   pattern   = a 3-vector of strings; a slot is a VARIABLE iff it appears in
;               the query's explicit variable list (patterns stay homogeneous,
;               which the HM engine requires)
;   env       = a dynamic map of var-name -> value (see empty-env)
;   failure   = the empty collection; unify returns 0-or-1 envs (the option
;               monad as a 0/1-element collection — no failure-sentinel union)
;   log       = a list of facts, built with (lst ...)
;   proposal  = {:fact f :by "author"}
;   reaction  = (fn [fact log] -> facts to propose)
;
; Collection discipline: the HM engine types vector literals as Vector but
; pins polymorphic collection parameters to List, so facts/patterns (fixed
; 3-slot tuples, read only with nth) are vector literals, while every
; collection that flows through a function parameter is built with `lst`.
;
; The kernel is pure: `opeval` takes the log and proposals as values and
; returns the new log, so the suite needs no effects and no host bindings.

; --- helpers -----------------------------------------------------------------

; List construction: `(concat [...literal...] [])` is the portable way to
; build a List from a vector literal — the HM engine types vector literals as
; Vector but pins polymorphic collection parameters to List, and its `concat`
; always returns List. (A variadic helper would be nicer, but `&` rest params
; are untypeable on the HM engine.)

; the dynamic-map seed: assoc with a runtime string key makes the type a
; dynamic Map (not a fixed record) on the HM engine; runtime value is {}
